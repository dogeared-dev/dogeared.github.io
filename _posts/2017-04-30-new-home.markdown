A few days away from 6 years ago I started this blog and hosted it on
[wordpress](https://wordpress.org/). Wordpress has an awesome community, so many
plugins and is (relatively) easy to setup. But, I've always found it a bit
heavyweight for a blog.

As a developer and contributor to many open source projects, I live and breath
markdown. So, it seems like a more natural fit to use [Jekyll]() for the blog
tech and to just host it on Github pages. It's free and thanks to the
[Jekyll-uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) plugin, looks great on
desktop and mobile.

I am going to port over my posts from over the years, but it will take a little
while. Since I've been a fair weather blogger (at best), it won't take too long.

You can see the old posts

In the meantime, I ported over one of my personal favs from back in the day:
my weekend project of restoring a [Dark Tower](/2011/10/16/weekend-project-fix-dark-tower/) game to its original glory.
